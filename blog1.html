      <h1><!-- Blog title -->The Good, the Bad, and the Great White Buffalo</h1>
      <div id="bannerImage"><img src="images/GWBbanner.PNG" alt=""/></div>
      <p>Before I begin, I have a confession. I am a millennial, iGen, Gen Y, whatever. The delineation of “The Millennial”, varies widely depending on who you ask …. I have seen anywhere from 1977 to 2005. According to our media, we have been raised by forward-thinking-free-loving hippies, disco-don’ts, and basically any of the stereotypes from the movie Breakfast Club, television, and social media. The Me Generation; we are all the most important person in the world, we even get trophies for participation. The world owes us livable wages regardless of occupation, education, and prowess. By livable wages, I mean not only being able to afford rent, cable, water, garbage disposal fees, internet, cable, car insurance, and groceries; I also mean healthcare, childcare, education, entertainment, the newest iPhone… I could go on, but I think you get my point. Being raised in a family that made its living by either working for, or operating small businesses, allowed me to see things differently than the majority of my peers. I got to see what it means to earn a living rather than being given one, which is the greatest life lesson that I have learned thus far… Right up there next to “never drink orange juice after you brush your teeth”… even thinking about it makes me cringe.
      </p>
      <p> I have worked my way from cleaning offices, to reception work, outside and inside sales, account management, all the way through to technical support and engineering. I began as a so-so (cough sub-par cough) employee, only putting in enough effort to meet the minimum requirements of the position. My managers began to see less value in me, thus putting me at risk of being deemed unnecessary. Yikes! The moment that I invested more energy, I began to see incredible results. My managers began investing in my training, and they gave me more responsibility. I saw the end-game Hallelujah!!!!</p>
      <p>Working for the same company for as long as I have, naturally, I began to take notice of my co-workers. I began to see a pattern in the people who came and went. My managers are always on the lookout for what I refer to as “The Great White Buffalo” or G.W.B. for short, thank you Hot Tub Time Machine, this is not a reference to the Holy Grail of first loves, but rather an extraordinary employee with, but not limited to, the following traits: someone with a strong character, either related education or hands-on training in the field (don’t shoot me… too soon?), someone with a great presence, someone that deals well and energetically with customers, a McGyver-like problem solver, an excellent resource developer, someone that can handle a decent amount of pressure and stress, someone willing to work their way up on the pay scale, a dedication to the company’s bottom line, and a team player when it counts. The G.W.B. is extremely hard to find, especially with the stereotypical Millennial jumping out from behind every corner dressed in a perfectly tailored suit and a dazzling white smile</p>
      <p>As much as one stamps their feet and whines “I WANT MORE – I DESERVE MORE!!!” a company can only pay you what you prove to be worth. Here is a little trick… Think of the different departments of your company as their own independent companies. To be successful, your company/ department must make enough to cover its own expenses and if the stars align, a profit. The expenses have to cover employee wages throughout the department, office rent, various taxes, a variety of required insurances, phone and internet bills, office materials, if you sell tangibles be sure to include the cost to cover the initial expenses of buying the products, the cost of maintaining partnerships with manufacturers and clients, the cost of government compliancy, and so on. As an employee, if you make enough to cover your own wages, usage of office tangibles and intangibles, and your portion of the unavoidable business expenses, you are considered a “bare minimum” employee. Being a bare minimum employee puts you, in the worst case scenario, at serious risk of being deemed an unnecessary cost, and in the best case scenario, at serious risk of stagnating. This is a dangerous place, this Stagnate. Think of it as the “Friend Zone”, once you lose your momentum and begin to stagnate, it’s hard if not impossible to get moving and catch managements ever-critical eye again. If you earn the complete cost of your employment (including all the extra bells and whistles that most of us don’t think of), and help your co-workers meet their goals so that your company/ department as a whole pulls in a profit… THIS is where an individual will finally be considered for growth and wage increases… This my good friend, is the realm of the revered G.W.B. This ain’t no participation award.</p>
      <p>Every single new hire has a honeymoon phase, or the 90-ish day probationary period. During this stage most of us are excited for our new job. Everything is new and different and fresh. We are always on our best behavior. This more often than not, is not the real you! The real you comes out after this, once you have been battle tested and are road weary. Once you have somewhat learned the ropes and have worked that day, or several, or who am I kidding I lost count, days from hell, and you kept your head on straight with your eyes still glued to the prize. If an employee makes it beyond this point, they are officially in the G.W.B. qualifying race. If you can maintain this pace, and keep an eye on the company’s bottom line, there is no limit to how far you can grow with your company. Like most relationships these days, if you can make it through the 2 and 3 year humps, you will have graduated from a GWB qualifier to a full-fledged member of the G.W.B. The most prestigious of employee ranks. May theGWB force be with you.</p>
      <p>Long story short, dump the millennial mind frame, and set your pace for the distance not the sprint. You will not be disappointed and your employer will reward you in kind. Shoot… maybe you will become the employer. Live the American Dream… It doesn’t have to be a bedtime story or the wish you make when you blow out your birthday candles. The glass isn’t half empty or half full… If you’re thirsty, drink it!</p>
